# dada2OnHPC
This is my code for using DADA2 for ITS and SSU on the high performance computing cluster
The SSU primers target arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the ITS primers targer "all" fungi, generally.
This is designed to be self contained so that it can be run on our high perfomance computing cluster. Your system may differ and require some adjusted code.
